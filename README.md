# DC Taxi Dynamic Pricing System

## Data Context
The data set includes complete taxicab trip records for calendar year 2017. Each record includes information about the driver, vehicle, time and distance traveled, trip origin location, trip destination location, and the fare. Traditionally, taxi cab fares have been fixed to ensure consistency and uniformity for consumers, and fares have not been allowed to change with regard to demand or availability. In the last few years, the taxi cab industry in Washington, DC has lost market share as demand for taxi cabs has fallen and Transportation Network Companies have entered the market.

## Objective
As part of the agencyâ€™s commitment to encourage innovation in the for-hire vehicle industry, DFHV seeks to introduce a dynamic pricing system for taxi cabs. DFHV wants to implement three pricing tiers (eg, off-peak-normal-peak, or low-medium-high) based on trip data. The tiers could be based on times or areas that have more or less demand for taxi cab service. As the taxi cab regulator, DFHV sets taxi cab rates and would establish parameters for dynamic pricing, which taxi cabs would follow.

## Inspiration
- What times and/or areas should DFHV implement peak or high fares? How high should fares be raised? 
- What times and/or areas should DFHV implement off-peak or low fares? How much should fares be discounted?
- In your proposed dynamic pricing model, will individual drivers earn more? 
- Based on the data, are there other opportunities for a varying pricing structure?
- Are there other variables to consider for a dynamic pricing system?
